Abstract steps taken to learn Javascript which could be repeated to learn another language:

Learning by translation
- Reviewing programs previously written in another language(s) (in our case Ruby), and analysing the frequently used syntax/structures. Using this to create a "vocabulary/phrase list" containing the equivalent syntax in JavaScript as found by doing some research. Keeping the list for reference for key syntax and expanding upon it as and when coming across new "vocabulary/phrases" in the new language.
-Rewriting some simple programs eg FizzBuzz using the above vocabulary, to see how they can be translated, and gain more idea about the structures of the new language.
