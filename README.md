Abstract steps taken to learn Javascript which could be repeated to learn another language:

Learning by translation

-Reviewing programs previously written in another language(s) (in our case Ruby), and analysing the frequently used syntax/structures. Using this to create a "vocabulary/phrase list" containing the equivalent syntax in JavaScript as found by doing some research. Keeping the list for reference for key syntax and expanding upon it as and when coming across new "vocabulary/phrases" in the new language.

-Rewriting some simple programs eg FizzBuzz using the above vocabulary, to see how they can be translated, and gain more idea about the structures of the new language.


Concrete actions taken to learn JavaScript:

-During pairing on first afternoon, doing the above for FizzBuzz. Marianne and I looked at our FizzBuzz programs written in Ruby. Researched the syntax required in JavaScript, and rewrote FizzBuzz in the console in JavaScript.

-Furthered learning of basic syntax by completing some stages of Codacademy basic JavaScript course.

-Learnt some JavaScript "grammar" at the encapsulation with prototype and constructor workshop on Weds 3.12. Read Ch8 Classes and Ch5 Objects in JavaScript Pocket Reference by David Flanagan to try to improve understanding. Worked on creating "Greeter" object in JavaScript during pairing challenge in afternoon with Marjan.

-Thurs 4.12 Started Fizzbuzz TDD in Javascript in pairing challenge.Learnt some syntax for writing tests in Javascript using Jasmine.

-Fri 5.12 Learnt use of console.log() to gain visibility when debugging JavaScript code. Did some more work on FizzBuzz TDD in JavaScript.

-Mon & Tues 8 & 9.12 Learnt more about constructor function and prototype, new and this keywords and writing the test syntax in JavaScript for a Thermostat object.

-In asynchronous Javascript workshop of 8.12, gained some understanding of callback functions in Javascript, how functions are objects in the language and can be passed as arguments in other functions and how this differs to Ruby.

Reflection on process of learning JavaScript:

If I were to start the process over again, I would not assume that structures were the same as those I had previously learnt in Ruby, and that they could be directly translated, which I recall was my starting point. I would spend less time on learning the basic "vocabulary" and try to understand the key differences in the "grammar" better eg the encapsulation using constructor function and prototype instead of Ruby class, so I could more quickly get on with trying to rewrite some of the programs written previously. If I had more time, I would also look for more examples of simple programs (not just the ones we have written and rewritten) so I could see how the JavaScript code I have learnt works in more contexts and to help my understanding of how encapsulation works in JavaScript.
