#Abstract steps taken to learn Javascript which could be repeated to learn another language:

Learning by translation

- Reviewing programs previously written in another language(s) (in our case Ruby), and analysing the frequently used syntax/structures. Using this to create a "vocabulary/phrase list" containing the equivalent syntax in JavaScript as found by doing some research. Keeping the list for reference for key syntax and expanding upon it as and when coming across new "vocabulary/phrases" in the new language.

-Rewriting some simple programs eg FizzBuzz using the above vocabulary, to see how they can be translated, and gain more idea about the structures of the new language.


#Concrete actions taken to learn JavaScript:

-During pairing on first afternoon, doing the above for FizzBuzz. Marianne and I looked at our FizzBuzz programs written in Ruby. Researched the syntax required in JavaScript, and rewrote FizzBuzz in the console in JavaScript.

-Furthered learning of basic syntax by completing some stages of Codacademy basic JavaScript course.

-Learnt some JavaScript "grammar" at the encapsulation with prototype and constructor workshop on Weds 3.12. Read Ch8 Classes and Ch5 Objects in JavaScript Pocket Reference by David Flanagan to try to improve understanding. Worked on creating "Greeter" object in JavaScript during pairing challenge in afternoon.
